## Design Principles

This project was built with the following principles:

1. **Privacy First** - End-to-end encryption by default
2. **Decentralized** - No central point of failure
3. **Security** - Industry-standard cryptography
4. **Clean Code** - TypeScript with full type safety
5. **Well Documented** - Comprehensive guides and API docs
6. **Educational** - Learn P2P and E2E encryption concepts
